# Web Server Playground
This directory hosts a PlatformIO project using the ESP-IDF framework.

The intent is to learn how to turn an ESP32 into a standalone WiFi access point
that serves a small set of static content (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) to a
client browser and establish two-way communcation using WebSockets.
