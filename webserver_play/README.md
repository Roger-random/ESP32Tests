# Web Server Playground
This directory hosts a PlatformIO project using the ESP-IDF framework.

The intent is to learn how to turn an ESP32 into a standalone WiFi access point
that serves a small set of static content (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) to a
client browser and establish two-way communcation using WebSockets.

Released under MIT license, anyone is allowed to copy from this project
but it's probably not a good idea. This project was only a proof-of-concept
and is very rough, lacking refinements such as comments and error handling.

Once this project got far enough to prove the concept is possible, it was
folded into [Sawppy Rover](https://github.com/Roger-random/Sawppy_Rover)
ESP32 controller project. Further refinements can be found in that repository.
